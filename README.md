# Lonf | Fruit Picking

A simple fruit collection script that I made for my server, I made it using ox_lib so if you want to use it, install it.

The Player will only be able to start collecting the fruits after entering the service, after that some trees will be available where he can collect the fruits, after collecting them there will be a cooldown of 30 seconds so the player will have to look for another tree.
If you have any problems or ideas for improvements to the script, I'll be happy if you share :)

Another thing, there is an "install" folder that contains the items that are placed in ox_inventory\data\items.lua and also has the images that are to be placed in ox_inventory\web\images

Dependencies: ox_lib

In the future I will add a little shop to sell the fruits, but for now I don't need them
